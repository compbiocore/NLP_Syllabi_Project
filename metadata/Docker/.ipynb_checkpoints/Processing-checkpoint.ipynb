thesis statement is your value judgmentcreate a transitional sentence or short paragraph that fluidly leads the reader into the overviewthe overview is not a synopsis of the play or a blow-by-blow

argumenttext analysis the argument is your case the heart of your thesis paper  think defense trial lawyer  the text analysis is how you argue your case  note keep your thesis statement up front in the anonymous readers mindthe text analysis includes information that will prove your thesis  provide significant citations not snippets of dialogue interpret the citation metaphorically what does it meanprovide research footnote to support your interpretationorganize your text analysis by following the story line as the action occurs in the script begin with the title to the end and honestly guide the anonymous reader through the story as it is written ie do not jump around in the text cherry-picking moments out of context that defend your thesisrecommendation on how to identify significant citations make a hard copy of the textplayhighlight the sections dialogue action descriptions that serve as evidence to prove your thesistype those highlighted passages into your paper and footnote themyou can then describe what happens in the un-highlighted passages that move you forward to your next significant citation a point that proves your thesisthe conclusion is the introduction

ladies and gentlemen of the jury i rest my casethe annotated bibliography is an archive of the evidentiary materials you used to present your argument and prove your thesis  the annotated bibliography is a brief description of each research source  be honest ie if you only read chapter 3 of a book acknowledge that  this proves that you actually read the resource material  as a fringe benefit the annotated bibliography provides you with a personal reference bibliography that you can use for future purposes take advantage of the bibliography provided in the btusa anthologies  nb the annotated
