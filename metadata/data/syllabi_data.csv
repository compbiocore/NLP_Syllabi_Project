BIOL,1480,S01,2018-Fall,16860,"Terrestrial Biogeochemistry and the Functioning of Ecosystems","Three fundamental multidisciplinary questions will be addressed: How do ecosystems work? What limits the growth of life on Earth? How are humans altering the framework in which all life exists? Earth is basically a closed chemical system, and the reactions that support life are fueled by sunlight. But added to this chemistry and physics is the tremendous influence of life. Life created an oxygen atmosphere; the evolution of biological nitrogen fixation exponentially increased how many organisms could exist, and the soils that support human food production developed only by biologically-mediated processes. Throughout Earth's 4.5 billion-year history changes in Earth's basic biogeochemical processes have been fairly slow. Under our inattentive stewardship, we have almost instantaneously altered all of the major element cycles. We will focus heavily on what these changes mean for life on Earth.

On the contrary, the goal is to convey to students that computer science is much more than programming!  All of the following fundamental computer science techniques are integrated into the course material: algorithms, data structures, analysis, problem solving, abstract reasoning, and collaboration.  Concrete examples are drawn from different subareas of computer science: in 0170, from arbitrary-precision arithmetic, natural language processing, databases, and strategic games; in 0180, from discrete-event simulation, data compression, and client/server architectures. <br>

The sequence is unique in teaching both the functional and imperative programming paradigms---the first through the languages Scheme and ML in CSCI0170; the second through Java in CSCI0180.  The sequence requires no previous programming experience.  Indeed, few high school students are exposed to functional programming; hence even students with previous programming experience often find this sequence an invaluable part of their education. 
<br><br>
Although students are taught to use programming languages as tools, the goal of CSCI0170/0180 is not merely to teach programming.  On the contrary, the goal is to convey to students that computer science is much more than programming!  All of the following fundamental computer science techniques are integrated into the course material: algorithms, data structures, analysis, problem solving, abstract reasoning, and collaboration.  Concrete examples are drawn from different subareas of computer science: in 0170, from arbitrary-precision arithmetic, natural language processing, databases, and strategic games; in 0180, from discrete-event simulation, data compression, and client/server architectures. <br>

This course will present a general overview of the historical, socio-cultural, academic, and political issues that provide context for the use and availability of adolescent literature today. It presents a strong introduction to contemporary texts that interest adolescents inside and outside of the classroom. Particular attention is paid to issues of reading engagement for striving adolescent readers, issues of access to literacy through adolescent literature, ways that adolescent literature can be paired with the classics, and issues of censorship in American public school classrooms and public libraries.  Students in this course will walk away with an understanding of the place of adolescent literature in today’s debates as well as a background in choosing, reading, and analyzing the literature itself. Written assignments include weekly reading responses, an annotated bibliography, and a short, 3-5 page paper.

On the one hand, this is supposedly the heroic era of Columbus, Machiavelli, Newton, and Montesquieu, when Europeans became increasingly global, urban, and critical. On the other hand, this period also saw the rise of judicial torture, new regimes of discipline, colonialism, and a robust belief in the unseen world of demons, angels, and witches.

Supposedly both impenetrable and hegemonic, it was seen to reconstitute what was discussed in programs in literature and the social sciences, and how it was discussed. Today the shoreline of study in the humanities has been transformed, but French theory’s moment is presumed to have past. This course will trace that history through key French texts (read in translation) written between the 1960s and 1990s.  Taught in English.

BIOL,2350,S01,2020-Spring,24453,"The Biology of Aging","Aging is a fundamental biological process. It is the major risk factor for age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and Alzheimer's, just to name a few. As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs. The goal of modern medicine is to increase healthy survival, as opposed to simply longevity. It is now generally acknowledged that increasing health span – the fraction of our life spans free of frailty and debilitating chronic disease – has become a realistic goal. This course will examine the new concept of "geroscience" – the molecular, cellular, and genetic foundations of the biology of aging, and how this knowledge can be applied to therapies for age-associated diseases.

JUDS,1722,S01,2020-Spring,24464,"Money, Power, Sex and Love: Gender and the Family in Modern Jewish History","Traditional Jewish society was patriarchal, though the forms this power took changed over time.  It was also limited, even subverted, by various roles played by women.  Since Jewish family life was very much under the control of Jewish women, the family was another place where women were able to wield power.  Examining the history of gender and family allows us to examine the limits of patriarchal control and construct a new, often surprising picture of how Jewish society actually functioned.  It also sheds new light on how the various forms of modern Jewish family we recognize today grew and developed.",syllabi/Mi3KGs5GVy3ux6uyoPD3FGeghovlIGXBNJw5Bb07.pdf,MPSL_Syllabus2020.pdf,1

SOC,0010,S01,2020-Spring,25560,"Perspectives on Society: An Introduction to Sociology","Social forces constrain and empower us, bond us together and push us apart. Sociology explores the workings of societies large and small: nations, organizations, communities, families, and other groups. How do societies shape action and identity, and why are social pressures so hard to defy? How do societies distribute wealth and power, and why do inequalities so often coalesce around race, ethnicity, class, and gender? How do established practices persist, and when do movements arise to challenge them? Examining such themes across a range of issues and topics, this course provides a springboard for future study throughout the social sciences.",syllabi/ElUjxn8yypsy4ZJXbF6GgePPPL7ocmYqohhJ6Pna.docx,2020SyllabusIntroSociologyFinal7.docx,1

This seminar develops an alternate genealogy of critique informed by feminist and queer of color perspectives. It eschews the modernist drive toward transparency, instead examining masquerade, mimicry, code-switching, duplicity, fugitivity, passing, and appropriation.
